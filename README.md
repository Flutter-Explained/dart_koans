# Dart Koan

A Koan is a learning method to learn a new programming language as developer friendly as possible.
That means you will work and correct code in an IDE with the right tools that you would also use in a Work environment.

This idea came up because there is currently a big interest in flutter and therefore also in Dart.



## Available Chapters
- [Chapter 1: Asserts](./lib/chapter_1_about_asserts.dart) - Find your enlightment by working with asserts in Dart.
- [Chapter 2: Strings](./lib/chapter_2_about_string.dart) - Working with Strings, concatinations and learning methods of the String object.

## Recommended Tools
### Intellij
If you have Android Studio / Intellij from Jetbrains you have the testing framework already in place.

1) Install the Plugin for Dart
2) Install a Dart SDK

Now you have a nice visual overlay for all your tests and can start learning dart.

### Visual Studio Code
1) Install the Plugin for Dart
2) Install a Dart SDK

Now you have a nice visual overlay for all your tests and can start learning dart. 

## How it works
![Koan Example](./assets/koan_example.gif)

You have two options to start that project.

### Running it from the terminal

Just start the
 
```
dart ./bin/main.dart
```

this will start the runner, you will have the task to change the code in the lib/folder to solve the challenges.
