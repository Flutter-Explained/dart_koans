# Dart Koan

A Koan is a learning method to learn a new programming language as developer friendly as possible.
That means you will work and correct code in an IDE with the right tools that you would also use in a Work environment.

This idea is grown because there is currently a big interest in flutter and therefore also in Dart.

## Available Chapters
- Chapter 1: Asserts - Find your enlightment by working with asserts in Dart.
- Chapter 2: Strings - Working with Strings, concatinations and learning methods of the String object.


## Recommended Tools
### Intellij
If you have Android Studio / Intellij from Jetbrains you have the testing framework already in place.

1) Install the Plugin for Dart
2) Install a Dart SDK
3) Setup the Test Runner

Now you have a nice visual overlay for all your tests and can start learning dart.

### Visual Studio Code
1) Install the Plugin for Dart
2) Install a Dart SDK
3) Setup a Test Runner in Debug to run all tests

Now you have a nice visual overlay for all your tests and can start learning dart. 


## How it works
You have two options to start that project.

### 1) Using your IDE (recommended)
    
To start it from the IDE you have to setup according to "recommended Tools".

### 2) Running it from the terminal

Just start the
 
```
dart chapter-1-asserts.dart
```

with that it will run the first tests if you finished the first chapter go further to chapter 2 and so on.
