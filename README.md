# Dart Koan

A Koan is a learning method to learn a new programming language as developer friendly as possible.
That means you will work and correct code in an IDE with the right tools that you would also use in a Work environment.


## How it works
Just start the
 
```
dart chapter-1-asserts.dart
```

with that it will run the first tests if you finished the first chapter go further to chapter 2 and so on.
